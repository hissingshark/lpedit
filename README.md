## Hardware that we want to support

- POD HD 500
- POD HD 400
- POD HD 300

## Manual building
### Qt based GUI
You will need my patched verion of QT bindings for golang available at:
https://github.com/StarAurryon/qt

Then run the following commands:
```
go get -v github.com/StarAurryon/lpedit (this would not compile as qtdeploy must be run to generate missing go file)
$(go env GOPATH)/bin/qtdeploy
```
##
### GTK based GUI
You need to first run:
`go get -v github.com/StarAurryon/lpedit`

Then compile with:
`go build -tags GTK`

## Known bugs

- The software may crash when starting to listen to the POD events;
- I need to kill the software when exiting or stopping the communication with the pod:
  - You need the kernel 5.8 at least to fix this issue.
